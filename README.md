# Daily Scheduler

## Description

Welcome to the Daily Scheduler! An application set to help users keep track of their daily events with ....wait for it.....<span style="color:green">*C*</span><span style="color:purple">*o*</span><span style="color:red">*l*</span><span style="color:orange">*o*</span><span style="color:yellow">*r*</span><span style="color:cyan">*s*</span>!!

The Daily Scheduler affords users to save daily events in specific time blocks, and depending on the user's current time-of-day, the time blocks will change colors to notify the user if the event has passed, is within the current hour, or is still lingering in the near future!

## Usage

The Daily Scheduler was designed to be simple yet efficient. The layout relfects this by being sectioned off into three key areas(right to left): Time, Text Area, and Save Button. 

Time: On the left side of the User's screen, time blocks will be listed starting from 9AM and ending at 5PM. Here the user will decide what time block they would like their input to be located in. Next, the Text Area!

Text Area: The text box directly to the right of the User's decided time is where to put the user wanted text. To the Save Button!

Save Button: Clicking the blue save button will save the User's text input (to their own browser's local storage). This feature is important because now the User is able to refresh the page and their data is still present until they are ready to delete.

We save the best for last!
So, cool. A user can type and save data...big woopty (probably not how to spell that), anybody can do that!

...But not so fast!...

The Daily Scheduler not only keeps track of the events you want to store, but it changes the color of the text box so the User knows if, and when, an event has passed (textbox will display <span style="color:gray">*Gray*</span>), is within the same hour (text box will display <span style="color:red">*RED*</span>) or if an event is in the future (text box will display <span style="color:green">*Green*</span>). How Cool?! Enjoy!
